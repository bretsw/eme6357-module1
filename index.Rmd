# Evaluation vs. research <br> (Boothroyd, 2018)

---

# Defining evaluation

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/measure.jpg")
```

--

*systematic collection of information, for use by people to make decisions to improve training programs*

---

# Evaluation vs. research

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/tools.jpg")
```

--

- Both are rigorous

--

- Both allow for similar designs and methodologies

--

- **Evaluation** is timely and constructive, aiming to improve programs

--

- **Research** is meant to produce generalizable knowlege, aiming to better the field

---

# Types of evaluation <br> (CDC)

---

# Formative evaluation

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/shape.jpg")
```

--

- Needs assessment

--

- Process/implementation evaluation

---

# Summative evaluation

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/pottery.jpg")
```

--

- Outcome/effectiveness evaluation (objective, performance indicators)

--

- Impact evaluation

--

- Economic evaluation (cost, cost-benefit, cost-utility)

# Methods of evaluation <br> (WHO)

# Flipgrid Discussions

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/chat.jpg")
```

--

- Text, audio, and video comments are all fine

--

- 30-second comments can be just as good as 90-second ones

--

- Responding to those who respond to you is great (threads)

--

- Ending your comments with a question is great

--

- **Main rubric: Move the the conversation forward**

---

# Case Study Facilitation

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/chat2.jpg")
```

[Read the Case Study Discussion Facilitation instructions](https://canvas.fsu.edu/courses/181923/assignments/1299968?module_item_id=3197033)

--

- **Part 1: Introduce the case.** Your materials will be posted on Canvas.

--

- **Part 2: Create a few discussion prompts.** Your prompts will be listed on Canvas as on Flipgrid.

--

- **Part 3: Keep the discussion going.** Stay active on Flipgrid.
